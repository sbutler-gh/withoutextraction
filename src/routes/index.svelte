        <h4>Local filmmaking / Media</h4>
        <p>The better a place is cared for, the more people will want to see it.</p>
        <p><a href="https://filmmakermagazine.com/113084-alex-pritz-the-territory-sundance-2022/">The Territory</a> and <a href="https://ifnotusthenwho.me/">INUTW</a> show that communities are producing film on the ground.</p>
        <p>Digital content is generating billions every year.  Frontline and Global South communities are capable of producing the media set in their own places, and benefitting from legacies of their care themselves.</p>

        <h4>Local science / research</h4>
        <p>The better a place is cared for, the more cures, discoveries, and innovations it holds.</p>
        <p>Pharmaceuticals have a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioprospecting#Biopiracy">biopiracy</a> medicinal research and innovations in places of rich biodiversity â€” without sharing incomes with the communities themselves.</p>

        <h4>Regenerative Agroforestry</h4>
        <p>The better a place is cared for, the more fruit it gives</p>
        <p>Around the world, farmers earn greater incomes through regenerative agroecoforestry than industrial farming and deforestation.</p>
        <p>Why kill the land, rivers, and forests, when we can receive more gifts by supporting them?</p>
